<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

![image1][image1]

### Project Description
This app is a great learning experience for children ages 7 to 9. It incorporates fun with basic education. The user will be able to explore multiple categories, each with a different theme that will not only interest a certain group of children, but all of them at the same time with one app! 

The categories range from typical math problems to storytelling. Every category has its own color scheme and look that makes it child friendly and encourages them to want to learn more. This app is a great way to help improve child development with quizzes. One of the categories will have a feature where it plays a sound that goes along with each question which the user will need to pair with one of the four possible answers. 

After each category’s questions have been answered, the app will display the users score for that category or combined score overall depending on how many categories they have finished along with a motivational response according to how they have performed either way. The app incorporates imagery and sound to grab more attention from the user. Some of the imagery includes patterns and to match the right one to a string of other patterns. 

The user will be able to choose a profile pic from their gallery. It will then be used as their picture that will be displayed throughout the app while exploring. The app also gives the user the option to reset their current profile or to reset their high score. This app will definitely leave you to be one excellent kid!

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the backend of the application.

### Implementation Process

#### Design Architecture
`Activities` to design the pages used in Kidcelence.

#### Highlights

* One highlight was to `research` a new age gap and design around it.
* The `UI/UX design` was to help children improve their Cognitive and Sensory awareness skills.
* The best part was to load the app onto a `real device`.
* `Finishing` the project brief in time of the `deadline`.

#### Challenges

* Was a challenge to get the profile picture feature to work.

### Reviews and Testing
The `Reviews and Testing` consists of `google forms`, as well as if there were peer review testing.

#### Future Implementation

* Add more `questions` to the app.
* Improve the layout on multiple devices and `performance`.
* Add `animations` instead of just static images.
